3.0.4:
- WARNING: Do not load any worlds with McJtyLib 3.0.3 or earlier if you last saved them with McJtyLib 3.0.4 or later!
- Joseph fixed log warnings due to tile entities being registered with names like "minecraft:xnet_controller" instead of "xnet:controller".
- Joseph made a bug in NEI just log an error and not crash us
- Various changes for Ariente

3.0.3:
- Again a fix with opaqueness. It was not done correctly last time
- A few new features for the upcoming Ariente mod
- Joseph tried to work around an issue with NEI sometimes causing the GUI's from McJtyLib to fail. This is not fixed yet but now it should crash earlier. If you have this problem a lot remove NEI for now

3.0.2:
- Fixed a problem with default opaqueness of all blocks

3.0.1:
- Various blocks in RFTools could no longer be infused and also didn't show their current infusion value (already infused blocks would still do their bonus however)

3.0.0:
- Major refactoring and changes. Updating McJtyLib will require an update of all mods that need it
- New more flexible color picker widget
- New ‘tallChunkFriendly’ config in McJtyLib which changes to a less efficient way to encode positions but one that is more friendly towards mods that increase the maximum build height
