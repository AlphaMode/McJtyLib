3.0.1:
- Various blocks in RFTools could no longer be infused and also didn't show their current infusion value (already infused blocks would still do their bonus however)

3.0.0:
- Major refactoring and changes. Updating McJtyLib will require an update of all mods that need it
- New more flexible color picker widget
- New ‘tallChunkFriendly’ config in McJtyLib which changes to a less efficient way to encode positions but one that is more friendly towards mods that increase the maximum build height
